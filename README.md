 This project uses an STM32 Microcontroller to capture the response of an RC Circuit. The data points are passed over serial to a PC, which reads the data and plots it.

 gui.py is to be run on the PC, and generates a user interface which allows the user to start the data capture. The data is then plotted in the window.

 step_response.py is to be run on the microcontroller, and upon reboot runs a data capture cycle. A reboot command is sent from the PC to the microcontroller to initiate data capture.

 The following plot was created using this project:
